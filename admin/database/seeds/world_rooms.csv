where the Talis River plummets from the top of a cliff into the ocean to
the south, and even some of the larger boats in the harbor.  From here, the
city's corruption and general state of decay are things unseen and

door is framed with wide slabs of it.  The floor and even the ceiling are
pieced together with massive squares of obsidian, and a large table-like
structure in the center of the room is its only embellishment - also
crafted of black stone.  The table has deep gouges along the top, running
down the edges to hollowed out sections at each corner.  Weathered leather
straps and metal chains and hooks garnish it about every face, and appear
to be the only non-obsidian items in the room.  Gaping at the table and its

magnificent.  Ruddy streams of daylight peer in around the guildhall's
obsidian monolith where it punctures the ceiling.  And what stands against
the western wall, but a route through which necromancers might escape to

"25","1937","2475","A Small Home","This modest dwelling is where someone new to Cimar has made his or her
home.  Nestled inside Cimar's massive outer wall, it's right in the middle
of the rather undesirable plot of land which is New Cimar;  between the
cityguard headquarters and the army's barracks however, there's very little
traffic, creating a surprisingly relaxed environment.  Looking around, you
note dozens - perhaps hundreds - of personal affects strewn about,
decorating every possible flat surface.  The walls are covered with
paintings and maps, the tabletops and shelves are buried under delicate
porcelain and rough hewn dolls.  To the north is a quiet bedroom.

head of the bed.  The wall to the east is cracked for the entire floor-to-
ceiling length, and cold air flows in through the gap from the tight cool
space between walls.  As a result, the room is pleasantly cool despite the
sometimes oppressive heat of New Cimar's activity.  The bed is simple but
appears quite comfortable, with ragged and patched sheets covering it.  A
very few personal affects adorn a chest of drawers with a large mirror -
which, despite its obvious wear, is quite a distinguished and expensive
thing for a denizen of New Cimar to own.  Back to the south, the rest of
the house glows warmly.  Through a hazy window to the west, you can make
out the motion of passersby on the street outside.

overwhelming.  Beautiful green plants adorn the walls and ceiling, draped
down to create an almost forest-like effect.  The air is warm and moist,
and reeks heavily of the sweet scent of pure oxygen.  A few plain brown
pillows rest on the floor, and a single small bookshelf sits against the
back wall.  None of the noise from outside this room intrudes within;
whether by some effect the dozens of plants produce or by a magical
enchantment, this is a perfectly quiet abode despite being across a busy
street from the mage block and right next to some very noisy and dirty
homes.

Cimar and the highly trained Cimarrite Army.  For now, though, these things

of that, the wall makes ready to cross the Talis River by way of a grand
arch.  To your east, a small bridge crosses the river, and to the west stands
the cityguard headquarters.

A huge grove of trees at the very center of the city, the Heart was lovingly
tended to by each and every citizen of that ancient metropolis.  It was
considered to be that which held Kost's walls against a thousand armies, which
led the city to thousands of years of prosperity, which made the gods smile
down upon Shalar.  And then, in the Great War, it was lost.  This tiny
collection of venerable trees, tightly banded in the center of Old Cimar, is
all that remains of the once-thriving Heart of Kost.  Up against Cimar's inner
wall and only a few feet from its bustling business district, civilization is
closing in on all sides.  None of the citizens care for it enough to let it
thrive again, and only the rangers who live here now tend to it at all.

live their entire lives in this grove, and birds of all sizes wash themselves

palace's architect has created it from the same rare white marble which
makes up the rest of the extravagant building.  A few drops of wax here and
there make it clear to you that this passage is occasionally used (and the
way lit with a candle), though it has not been in some time judging by the
coating of dust on top of the dried droplets.  Perhaps it is an escape
route which has been forgotten after years of peace in the city.

is also constructed of white marble, a lace-like latticework of designs
which seems so feathery and light that it couldn't support a man's weight -
and yet, it is where the king sits daily to dispense his wisdom and
rulings.  At the top of the elaborate chair perches a stylized boar with a
too-large head and huge teeth, its glistening marble tusks protruding
perhaps a bit farther than they should.  To the east, a blindingly white
archway leads to the main room of the palace.

wooden stairwell leading up one corner of the chamber, first past the huge
columns on the bottom level, then stretching on beyond the smaller columns
above that, and finally passing the ornate frescoes and stained glass
windows at the top level.  It leads to a small balcony at the very top of
the room, where a few priests seem to be congregating.  Several pulpits are
set up in this room;  one from which to preach each sort of religion, one
might assume.

burn at various lengths.  Puddles of wax coat every shelf.  Each religious
zealot who comes through this guildhall lights a candle in some symbolic
showing or another, and each of them believes deeply that it is a great

this guild knows the importance of having a god on his side.  Symbols have
been drawn all over the flat surfaces of the room, culminating in a huge
pentagram which takes up nearly all the floor space.  Vicious weapons and
elaborately decorated armor dangle from hooks and pegs everywhere, and
droplets of the blood of the sacreligious and heretical prove to be the
only thing marring any of it.

were called from all over the region to design a tribute to the city's
longevity.  This gorgeous and elegant arching tower of ivory was the result.

itself as a free-standing structure;  yet, it has stood centuries more since

mountain and away from the salty air of the ocean to the south.  Trees
flourish here, healthy and strong, and the correct shade of green.  Far
from the pollution of the decrepit sections of the city, regal High Cimar
is awash in cleanliness, decency, and beauty which is rivaled in few other
cities.  To the west, High Avenue streaks out the north gate, and to the
south, Toller Road drives its way east and west.  Off to the west, you see
the temple of High Cimar, and beyond that Cimar's palace at the city's
highest point.

building, and the ceiling is a huge black slate slab.  To one side, you see
off-white marble with gold veins of color, and below you you see black with
ghostly gray stripes.  A desk stretches across the length of the room, an
obsidian top perched upon a stand of gold-flecked bricks.  This is where the
riches of Cimar reside;  the bank of the largest city on the continent.  Just
below the black-as-pitch tabletop, you see a sign detailing the banking
process.  Through an open door to the south, you see the traffic of West
Toller Road bustling by.  Given the highly public placement of this building,
it would be a reasonable assumption that your money will be safe here.

pieces of paper;  each has printed upon it a price, a number, a secret

since the last auction.  A wind blows through, and momentarily a blizzard of
varicolored papers swirls about you in a blinding whirlwind.

yourself surrounded by a large number of citygoers, from businessmen and
merchants to fairly obvious thieves and purse snatchers.  While there isn't

between the business district in Cimar's southwest quadrant and other parts
of the city.  This part of Toller Road is in Old Cimar, running parallel with
the inner wall to the north.  Lined on both sides by private homes and
branched from by several north-to-south avenues, it bustles with activity
through most of the day.  To the north stands the Bank of Cimar.

Perfectly clear large glass windows are positioned all around the hall, and
the room basks in glorious sunlight for most of the day.  That light is
refracted and reflected through the home by the nearly-mirrored floor, and by
crystalline fixtures the captain ordered in from overseas, and then had
placed strategically where a visitor's eyes would most likely be drawn to
them.

cobblestones under your feet to a smooth surface, almost flat and nearly
shining, reminiscent of dulled and unpolished marble.  Several of the city's
complacent Watchmen lounge at the edges of this massive contour, glaring at
passing members of the Cimarrite Army.  The street stretches off to the east,
and becomes a mountain route leading into the west.  Broker Avenue stretches
off to the south through the bustling business district of Cimar, while
Mount Cim dominates the entire setting from the sky to the northwest.

incredible variety of almost-transparent metal.  Another strange type of metal
is set into a lamp-like structure against one wall;  as it slowly burns -- as
if that weren't remarkable enough -- it sheds the light of the sun,
necessitating a shield so as not to blind customers.  Truly, marvels such as
this one might never have expected to see from a mere metal worker.  Perhaps
the man who works here sidelights as an alchemist.

a real elf's, and delicately feathered wings which stretch back along the
sides of the ship.  You cannot tell what these decorative structures have been
made of... wood would be a safe assumption, but nothing on the ship shows any
signs of wear.  Even the deck of this yacht is spotless and new.  Suddenly,

eyeballs, tails, fins, gills, and several bits which seem not to have come
from fish at all.  The whole ship creaks and whines in protest as the waves

of grime packed between them, and the corners of the deck are far from
spotless.  However, it is in a very good state of repair.  The rigging is
brand new, no frayed rope or splintered wood has been allowed to go

North lies the cavern entrance, while south leads back towards the plains.
East and west are blocked by the walls of the mountain cleft.

"30","2204","3208","Inside the Cave Mouth","Breaching the side of the mountain, a cool crisp breeze rushes at you. In
its wake, it leaves a mixture of smells that remind you of unwashed bodies
and mold. The air in the immediate area seems to be reaching a stable,
cool temperature as well. Even this short distance into the mountain, you
already have the sense of thousands of tons of stone, rock and dirt
overhead. Southward, a faint light glimmers and you can almost hear the
birds chirp, while eastward the tunnel continues it's ancient trek inward.

large bookshelf.  What you can see of it is inscribed with strange magical
runes and icons.  Covering the shelf are hundreds of books and tomes, their
paper yellowed with age.  The books seem free of dust, though a smeared
reddish substance is evident on many of them.  The combined smells of aged

"38","2677","4100","Above the Forest Floor","Broad, flat limbs extend themselves from this massive tree in a rather
neat spiral, virtually creating a winding staircase which runs into the
forest canopy above, and to the floor far below.  The mottled trunk is
impossibly wide, even at this height, and a host of forest creatures appear
to reside in its dark nooks and furrows.  A short distance above, the trunk
splits into two mighty halves.  Built into the tree near the split a large
platform can be seen.  A rope ladder hangs from above to offer access.

"38","2678","4101","A Platform High in the Trees","This sturdy platform consists of long, thick boards of beautiful hardwood
laid upon crossbeams built into the side of the mammoth tree.  The immense
trunk splits here, the two mighty halves reaching impossible heights into
the canopy, which grows even thicker above.  In spite of its intricate
construction, the platform is quite plain.  It's only ornamentation is a
large railing around the perimeter, which is certainly a detail of function
and not form.  The platform continues to the north and west, while a rope

polished and maintained, it remains obvious that this is no natural
formation.  A chipped carving is set into the ground here, worn away to the
point of unrecognizability.  It looks almost like two faces, and one has
wavy lines radiating out from it, but not much more can be told about the
once elaborate carving.  A thin black line runs up and down the northern
wall, but nothing else of note catches your eye.

of decomposition.  A small oil lamp provides the only meager light,

little one-room shack.  The shambling home sways on the tall, rotten stilts
that hold it up above the waterline.  The wood is warped with damp.  Each
board bulges away from its neighbor to leave gaping holes in the wall and
floor.  Though the sprawling decay does not in any way distinguish this shack
from any other in the village, it is clear that none have lived here for some
time.  Shards of glass and broken pottery cover the floor.  The thresholds to
the south and east hang empty, the doors long since stolen.  The one tiny
window in the northern wall hangs open, ringed with jagged teeth of broken
glass.  A slick layer of mold still clings to the floor from the last time
the waters rose to flood level and soaked the small house.  No foot has left
a mark in the filth nor hand moved to clear the clutter in many years.

Though this design is clever enough and might have once encouraged a close-

decrepit as the others, is blessed with two rooms rather than one and
actually contains some meager furnishings.  Three tables with mismatched
chairs fill the room, each heavy with empty mugs and the remnants of a card
game.  The floor is smooth and relatively clean, kept from mold and rot by
the frequent passage of feet in and out of this shack.  A crude tapestry
hangs on the southern wall, to cover the gaping, glassless window.  Though
the room is dirty and infested with the smell of decay, there is something
prosperous and busy about it.  To the west lies a smaller room, from which
you can hear the faint clinking of gold being counted.  In every other
direction, a roughly cut doorway allows access to the outside world.

is obscured beneath piles of papers, ledger books, and dirty trinkets and
charms of the most worthless variety.  Moth-eaten velvet bags, presumably
containing more of the same, fill the space beneath the desk.  A chair much
too large to suit the desk is placed behind it.  A curious black board hangs
on the northern wall, covered in an indecipherable scrawl.  Though as dirty
and unpleasant as any other room in the village, there is in this small
office the air of possession, the dirty sense of ownership to be found in a
rat's lair.

gather around four assorted tables.  Broken pottery and remnants of food have

and the salted hams and sides of beef hanging in the meat closet.  Insects

freshly served.  The lingering memory of every kind of gustatory indulgence
can be traced here; scents sweet and salty, meats and fruits and buttery
breads.  The four walls are closely set, the scant floorspace taken up with a
dining table and a single chair.  Bones litter the floor and sauces of every
variety stain the walls as well as the table.  Grease dripped from roasted
meats makes passage through the shack somewhat slippery.  It is odd to find
such evidence of gluttony in a home so poor and so ill-tended.  The warped
wooden boards in the wall let in the elements and the floor creaks with age.
Whoever inhabits this home has a very peculiar set of priorities.

helplessly to the corner of the room.  The sparse furniture seems
incongruously mundane in such a spectacularly bloody room.  A simple redwood
table with matching chairs would be perfectly at place in a sun-lit kitchen
or homely family room if not for the light sprinkling of blood dotting the
tabletop.  A threadbare rug on the floor was once white but now stained
maroon.  Strangely not all the stains are fresh.  Though the floor is wet
with newly shed blood, there are also old brown marks in amorphous
configurations.  Scuffs from past fights are carved into the walls,
accompanied by stains scrubbed but not erased.  A guttural moan rises to fill
the room and you shudder, uncertain if the sound comes from your throat or
another or simply arises from the faint wind slipping through the rotten
walls.

from what animal they were taken you could not say.  The musk of wild
animals, however, clings to the room.  A shelf on the western wall contains

large seat stands against the southern wall, made of earth and bone, looking
rather like a throne.  A throaty hum of prayer or curse fills the room,

"53","4154","10027","A decaying footbridge","A narrow little rope bridge joins two adjacent shacks, its rotten boards
unevenly placed.  The faint breeze, lazy as it is, shakes you as you stand,
exciting a chorus of creaks from the old ropes.  The village has designed its
own peculiar architecture in order to survive the malarial waters below and
the incoming tide to the south.  Each ramshackle house is up on long, wobbly
stilts and passage between them gained by short bridges such as this one.
Though this design is clever enough and might have once encouraged a close-
knit society within the village, now each bridge is precariously rotten,
dripping with parasitic moss, the damp boards wormeaten.  The relative
shelter of sprawling shacks lies to the east and west.

"53","4155","10028","A large white room","The large bedroom in this satin-cloaked shack is a shocking contrast to
every other home in the village.  Though no serious effort has been put into
permanently repairing the house, wall-length white satin banners cover the
disfigured wooden boards and flowered silk carpets cover the gaps and bumps
in the old floor.  Pleasant oil paintings hang from the white-silk walls.
Rich furnishings stand about the room: a bedstand, a writing desk with
matching chair, and a large, comfortable bed.  A large window in the southern
wall looks out onto the beach and the ocean beyond.  A shallow balcony in the
northwest corner of the room juts out from the building, giving a nearly
complete view of the messy, sprawling village, such a marked contrast to this
tidy, clean abode.

only the size of one room and that smaller than a rich man's closet.  Few
furnishings or ornaments adorn the room, only a narrow, filthy bed in the
corner.  Wine stains spread in maroon rings on the floor.  The air is rife
with the scent of stale beer and spilled mead.  Glass bottles lie haphazardly
around the room, some chipped, some shattered and lying dangerously jagged on
the ground.  Vomit long since dried and hardened sits undisturbed on the
floorboards.  Nor pictures, shelves, or even windows break the monotony of
the rotting walls.

its way toward the southeast, growing wetter with each step southward.  The
air is thick with the buzzing of insects and lazy rustlings of animals
underfoot.  The spot where you stand seems to be some sort of informal line
of demarcation.  The grasses and trees to the south are substantially more
overgrown and redolent with the smell of stagnation and rot, while northward
the way grows clearer.  As though to confirm this intuitive sense of
boundary, a broken piece of wood that might have once been a sign lies on the
ground.  Sudden laughter cuts through the humid air, high-pitched, perhaps
drunken, distant but clearly audible.  A sharp ear may catch the sandpaper
brush of the waves against the beach far to the south, but not the faintest
breath of fresh ocean air reaches this spot.

swamp and part the salty overflow from high tide.  The trail opens up here to
reveal a rambling, rotten village to the southeast.  Curious looking little
hovels stand several lengths above the water, elevated on thick but none-too-
sturdy poles.  The poles are long and once probably quite strong but years of
neglect have left them teetering and uneven, sprawling like the uncertain
legs of a newborn colt.  Wicked indulgence wafts from the village itself; the
brassy smell of lechery, the screeching sound of laughter and violence.  Like
a symphony the scent and sound permeate the village, running up the hill to
sing to you here with a kind of disfigured beauty.  Dark green, malarial
waters cover every inch of land in this small town without road or earth,
only greasy waterways and makeshift rafts to navigate them.

hardwood floor is of rich, crushed red velvet, and is trimmed with
golden thread.  Portraits of the Lord's ancestors are carved into the

effigy, a pair of diamonds gleam out from the eyesockets of the
fallen lord, gazing with cold indifference upon their successor from
the House of the Dead.

the vat, bottles of many vintages are kept and stored for later use.
Workmen can walk around the vat with barely five feet to spare between
the vat and the walls, and overseers' whips can barely reach down far
enough to hit the slaves.  Of course, when the serfs are slow, their
drips of blood merely flavour the wine and give it Avarast's
special touch.

unknown, presumably to be bottled after a short aging process.  The high
wooden walls of the vat prevent you from seeing anything other than the
low roof of the building.

and you can glimpse a large castle to the south, fields to the
northeast, and a similar tower to the one you stand on, far to the
west.  The edges of the tower seem to be crumbling, but you notice
that where you now stand looks to have been a place of private
worship, perhaps a gathering room for the priesthood.

by the iron ceiling supports and the beginning of tracks for the ore carts

examine the alcove closer, you notice the stones on the floor, walls and

everything repeatedly.  In one corner, partially concealed by dust and fallen
debris, you find a dull black shield-shaped disk, brittle with age and rough
around the edges.  The false wall to the west shimmers a magical dull gray
color, while light comes from the cave to the north.

rises no more than a few feet above your head, causing you to walk slightly
crouched.  Next to you, the underground river rushes past towards its

see beyond the water shooting out of the rapidly-narrowing crevice in the
stone, leaving you no clue as to where the river originated from.

corridor.  The room is made of the same grey stone that the rest of the temple
was, but here it seems to exude an aura of peace and tranquility.  The walls
are covered with carvings and strange writings of a language that you have
never seen.  Upon the floor there is a large carving of a sunburst, with a
small circle that is big enough for you to sit cross-legged in.  The walls
are completely clear of any cracks or holes and the entire room seems to be
in perfect condition.  Sitting near the north wall is the reason that this
room is lit with a golden glow, a large and beautiful altar blazes with light
and seems to emit a feeling of joy and love into you.  The only exit from this
beautiful room is back to the spiraling corridor to your south.

made of a cool grey stone that is coarse to the touch and is as unyielding and
strong as the mountains of the North.  A small layer of silt has begun to form
upon the ground and swirls into tiny clouds as you float past.  You assume
that this was a room to place the sacrifices to the altar, a storage room or
perhaps to hide something very important.  Upon the western wall, there is a
small alcove carved, quite cleverly as it is not very easily noticed.  To the
north, the perfect wall has been destroyed by some incredible force, creating
a rough tunnel that continues into the utter darkness.  The hidden door above
you beckons back to the brightly lit room of the altar.

manner as the tunnel, through a massive destructive force of some kind.  The
room is still littered with small pieces of rock and the water is extremely
murky due to the large amount of dust.  Nothing grows here at all, in fact you
can see the bones of dozens of fish upon the ground, many of them horribly
mangled and destroyed.  The ceiling is roughly rounded into the walls, creating
a sense of vertigo as you cannot truly tell which way is up while in the water.
Upon the western wall, you see a perfect steel door, easily standing out against
the rough walls.  To the south the rough tunnel leads back to the small room
beneath the altar.

extremely rough and pieces of stone still lie about.  The room is quite small,
and combined with its round shape, you feel extremely uncomfortable while in
here.  The small blasted chamber is completely bare of any sea life or fauna,
only the shadows seem to dance in the back of your head and your mind reels
constantly, making it hard to think.  A large ornate chest is partially melded
with the stone in the middle of the rounded floor, a large platinum padlock
protecting it from prying hands.  The steel door to your east stands out in
plain contrast to the rough walls, leading to the large rough-walled room.

cabinet -- also thirty feet long -- holds the most amazing amount of liquor
you've ever seen collected.  Loud men drink and shout, and women scurry back

spreading out across the ceiling, though not large enough for you to fit
through.  The entire room is bathed in a soft yellow light, which seems to
originate somewhere against the northern wall.  Investigating further, you
catch a glimpse of something shiny sticking out from under the stones.

find yourself awash in the sounds of the sea, as waves break against the
shore and gulls fly overhead -- you turn to watch them, and see nothing but
the light which surrounds you.  Subtly, the sound in the air shifts to
rustling leaves and a crackling fire; the scent of burning wood reaches you,
tickling you further toward consciousness.  As you become fully aware for
the first time, a booming voice strikes out through the white void: \"Welcome
to Shalar, young pilgrim.  You have chosen to inhabit this vessel, and I
commend you for your choice.  In the coming minutes, you will become
accustomed to life here; I will guide you by placing signs with the

you have entered is actually quite well-lit, with softly flickering candles
lining each wall.  Numerous portraits and busts fill your field of vision

movement you make kicks another cloud of it into the air.  The only clean
thing in the room is a bust at the south end of the room, up atop a marble
shelf.  The man depicted wears a tiny set of spectacles and has a
well-trimmed mustache.  Despite the fact that he is carved from stone, you

into this metal tomb, resonating in such a way as to discomfit the

you; the wall ripples and shivers for an instant, however, indicating that
you could probably push your way back through to the north if you wanted to.
Turning your attention to the rest of the space you've entered, the design
seems nonsensical until you realize that you are literally between the walls

you are being pushed out into the world by some great, warm invisible hand.

that it has likely been broken and reinforced several times in the last
century or so.  There are no lights in this section of the tunnel, but what

darkness.

firelight provides ample visibility on the floor, but strains to reach the
top of the room.  Despite this, you can make out a huge, black, wrought-iron
chandelier which is apparently in a state of disuse.  Behind each torch on
the walls, crude paintings of famous Shalaran heroes to have come through
here for training at some point early in their lives are proudly displayed.
